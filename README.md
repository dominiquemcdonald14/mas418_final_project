Welcome to our Job Scraper

This Scraper currently has 2 functionalities: recommender and summarizer. It's built using Flask and can be deployed by running the flask app. 

The main application for Flask is the jobscraper.py in /web_app/jobsite.

The initial scraping and cleaning can be found in the Glassdoor file and the R cleaning file respectively.

Please let us know if the code runs into any problems.
